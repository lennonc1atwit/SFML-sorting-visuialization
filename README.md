# SFML-sorting-visuialization
A tool written in c++ uisng SFML and ImGui used to visuialize sorting algorithms

## Dependicies used
  - OpenGL
  - SFML 2.5
  - ImGui SFML
  - ImGui

The program displays the sorting arrays state in the window and handles user input via ImGui. A sperate thread is used to control the actual sorting algorithm, currently only Insertion Sort and Selection Sort are implmented but I plan to add more in the future. 

## Implmented Sorts
  - Insertion
  - Selection

This project was done over the course of a weekend, the point of this project was not to demonstate my knowlage of sorting algorithms but to build a simple SFML project to practice implmenting ideas from start to finish and experiment with threads.
